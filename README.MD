# NeuralRecordings

In this repository, you will find the analyzed data of in vivo neural recordings from a V1 population of neurons. The data is sourced from a monkey (Macaca Fascicularis), showcasing the responses noted while segments of the movie 'Sleeper' were played to the monkey.

## Overview

- **Top Left:** Displays the segment of the movie that was showcased to the subject.
- **Center Top:** Illustrates the responses of a population consisting of 28 neurons, represented through their respective activity levels.
- **Below:** Features the comprehensive raster plot indicating the responses in the probed region of the cortex. It offers detailed insights into the image differences identified frame by frame alongside the total firing rate highlighted in blue signals.
